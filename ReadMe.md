## About the project

Since I was young I've been deeply interested in stage lighting, dreaming about designing and running both small and large shows, complex and simple. Particularly the entertainment sector was of great interest. Anything from school choir to Eurovision. My proffessional path didn't bring me in that direction but the interest never waned.

Unfortunately it would've been too expensive to keep solely as a hobby if I were to go the physical console route, so recently I've been thinking about the possibilities of using the knowledge I've gotten in the game industry to create a game engine and use it to create a lighting show visualizer software.

While many do exist already, even a few free ones, they are often as simple as possible and only intended for use temporarily until you can try the design at the proper venue.
In my case, the ultimate goal is to have a physically based lighting program that can be connected to existing lighting desks and software, and for it to be performant enough that VR support can be added, to be able to experience my own experiments in as real of a way as possible.

This will also serve as a reason to try to further my understanding of graphics programming and development for use in my game engine project.

## Project goals

* Create a program that allows for basic stage mockup and light placement.
* Create an asset pipeline for lights, including defining the different channels.
* Create a basic DMX data UI which allows changing the values in the visualizer directly.
* Learn the basics of [Art-Net](https://art-net.org.uk/).
* See if it's possible to get it working with lighting consoles, even if just the free [ChamSys MagicQ](https://chamsyslighting.com/products/magicq), which should support Art-Net.
* Look deeper into light rendering for my game/graphics project.
* Virtual Reality support - Being able to experience your own lighting rig in a virtual reality setup.
